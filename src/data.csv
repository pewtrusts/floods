redirecting,Arkansas,Arkansas Tax Credit Rewards to Landowners for Resilience,"Arkansas has lost more than 70 percent of its wetlands, making it harder for the state to combat seasonal floods along the Arkansas and Mississippi Rivers. Arkansas’ ability to protect these areas is limited because many wetlands and riparian zones—the areas bordering rivers and streams—are privately owned. But a state tax credit, first instituted in 1995 and expanded in 2009, has helped address the loss of these critical landscapes. The incentive applies to landowners who restore, enhance, or create wetlands on their property or who donate wetlands and/or riparian zones to the state. Since 1995, the state has approved nearly $4.2 million in tax credits for projects to protect or create more than 2,800 acres of wetlands and riparian zones.

Starting in the 1940s, development increased the number of paved surfaces in the small village, which intensified flooding. After a severe storm in 1990, village officials created a rebate program for residents who complete projects to prevent flooding on their property. As of February 2019, 1,172 households had received more than $800,000 in rebates by installing $2.9 million worth of flood-proofing projects.",Inadequate storm water system and flooding to community and homes,Rebate program for residents to make their homes more resilient,$800K rebated on $2.9M in flood proofing projects ,mm-flood-cropped-940.jpg,mm-flood-cropped-940.jpg
redirecting,Vermont,Vermont’s Fund Helps Communities to Become More Flood Ready,"When Tropical Storm Irene hit the East Coast in August 2011, flash flooding in central and southern Vermont badly damaged many homes as well as roads, bridges, and other infrastructure. The degree of destruction led the state’s legislature to update the Emergency Relief Assistance Fund later that year. The fund gives more assistance following disasters to cities and towns that take action to bolster their resilience to floods, and less to those that don’t. State investment in the fund is paying off: Enticed by the promise of more aid, communities in Vermont are taking steps to lessen the impacts of future storms.

redirecting,Washington,Washington Floodplains by Design,"Washington state is taking a holistic approach to mitigating flood risk. Having spent millions in past decades on disconnected strategies, the legislature in 2013 supported a partnership formed that year by several nonprofits, the state department of ecology, and other stakeholders to address the root cause of flooding: the manipulation of Washington’s rivers and development in floodplains. The partnership’s initiative, called Washington Floodplains by Design (FbD), takes a collaborative approach to projects such as removing levees, reconnecting floodplains to their rivers, and acquiring land to relocate residents from flood hazards. Since 2013, FbD has distributed more than $115 million in grants to cities, tribal governments, and other entities for floodplain projects, with an additional $50 million approved for the 2019-2021 cycle.

From June to August of that year, flooding across the Midwest, including Wisconsin, caused 50 deaths and $15 billion in damage. To make communities more resilient, Wisconsin’s legislature created a grant program that helps property owners leave flood-prone properties and converts their land to open space, such as wetlands or recreational areas. From 2002 to 2016, the program funded buyouts of 127 structures, reducing the risk for homeowners and helping to contain future floods.",Series of flood disasters including Great Flood of 1993 ,State grants for a range of activities including buyouts,127 structures no longer in harms’ way,mm-flood-cropped-940.jpg,mm-flood-cropped-940.jpg

From Jan. 1, 2013 to Oct. 31, 2018, the state reported 987 flood events, with damages exceeding $10 million. Going further back, Indiana has endured a number of major floods, such as one in 2008 that caused over $1 billion in damages to the state. Motivated by the frequency of small floods, as well as the devastating impacts of major storms, Indiana officials in the 1950s adopted a Flood Control Revolving Loan Fund to support projects that can mitigate the effects of flooding, and in 2016, state leaders made important improvements to the program.

In Cedar Rapids alone, 5,200 homes were destroyed or in disrepair after two weeks of historic rainfall. As the state recovered, policymakers used a portion of federal disaster assistance to create authorities tasked with reducing flood risk across watersheds—as opposed to a more localized, project specific approach. The agriculturally dominant state later established a long-term funding source for communities seeking to mitigate damage from future floods.

Since 2011, the state has been battered by six severe storms—including two hurricanes—requiring millions of dollars in federal public assistance.  To combat shoreline erosion caused by sea level rise and strong storms—and mitigate associated flooding—the state offers loans for “living shorelines” projects on waterfront properties. Since 1971, the Shore Erosion Control loan program has distributed nearly $3 million in loans for 475 living shoreline projects, protecting more than 200,000 linear feet of shoreline and creating over 3.7 million square feet of marsh.

Following three major floods in 2010, MNDOT used a portion of these funds—from bonds issued for road repairs—to make key highways less vulnerable to severe weather. Since 2011, the department has used this funding stream for 34 flood mitigation projects, such as raising roadways and bridges.

Recurrent flooding is a problem. To reduce its vulnerability to flooding, the city council adopted one of the nation’s strongest regulations on construction in a floodplain, with the aim of helping to ensure that projects don’t increase the risk of downstream flooding. The regulations have also lowered flood insurance premiums for many residents because of incentives in the federal flood insurance program.","2004 floods damaged 16,000 homes ",Policy requiring new developments or structural improvements to not worsen flood risk for property owners downstream,Lower flood insurance premiums for many residents.,mm-flood-cropped-940.jpg,mm-flood-cropped-940.jpg

The losses catalyzed city officials to pass stringent regulations in 2000 for construction in the Cache la Poudre River’s flood plain. The regulations prohibited residential construction in 100-year flood plains and required nonresidential development to be built at least 2 feet above projected flood levels. In September 2013, floods devastated many parts of Colorado, but the new policy helped Fort Collins escape relatively unscathed.

In response, the city has taken a watershed approach to flooding and wastewater treatment, particularly through green infrastructure initiatives.

The long stretch of inlets and beaches lures seasonal visitors, and the deep water offshore provided one of several rationales to build the country’s biggest naval base there. But in recent decades, changing precipitation patterns and sea level rise have led to recurrent flooding. In 2013, officials decided that Norfolk’s zoning ordinance did not support the city’s goals and needed to be overhauled to mitigate flooding and promote safer development.
