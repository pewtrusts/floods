redirecting,Arkansas,Arkansas Tax Credit Rewards Landowners for Conserving Wetlands,"Arkansas has lost more than 70 percent of its wetlands, making it harder for the state to combat seasonal floods along the Arkansas and Mississippi Rivers. Arkansas’ ability to protect these areas is limited because many wetlands and riparian zones—the areas bordering rivers and streams—are privately owned. But a state tax credit, first instituted in 1995 and expanded in 2009, has helped address the loss of these critical landscapes. The incentive applies to landowners who restore, enhance, or create wetlands on their property or who donate wetlands and/or riparian zones to the state. Since 1995, the state has approved nearly $4.2 million in tax credits for projects to protect or create more than 2,800 acres of wetlands and riparian zones.

redirecting,"South Holland, Illinois",Illinois Village Offers Rebates for Flood Mitigation Projects,"South Holland lies close to the Little Calumet River, 22 miles south of Chicago. Starting in the 1940s, development increased the number of paved surfaces in the small village, which intensified flooding. After a severe storm in 1990, village officials created a rebate program for residents who complete projects to prevent flooding on their property. As of February 2019, 1,172 households had received more than $800,000 in rebates by installing $2.9 million worth of flood-proofing projects.",Inadequate stormwater system and flooding to community and homes,Rebate program for residents to make their homes more resilient,"Village rebates more than $800,000 for $2.9 million in flood proofing projects",mm-south-holland.jpg,mm-south-holland-lores.jpg,#

redirecting,Washington,Washington Partnership Fosters Collaboration for Floodplain Restoration,"Washington state is taking a holistic approach to mitigating flood risk. Having spent millions in past decades on disconnected strategies, the legislature in 2013 supported a partnership formed that year by several nonprofits, the state department of ecology, and other stakeholders to address the root cause of flooding: the manipulation of Washington’s rivers and development in floodplains. The partnership’s initiative, called Washington Floodplains by Design (FbD), takes a collaborative approach to projects such as removing levees, reconnecting floodplains to their rivers, and acquiring land to relocate residents from flood hazards. Since 2013, FbD has distributed more than $115 million in grants to cities, tribal governments, and other entities for floodplain projects, with an additional $50 million approved for the 2019-2021 cycle.

redirecting,Wisconsin,Wisconsin Grant Program Helps People Relocate from Flood-Prone Areas,"The Great Flood of 1993 is considered one of the worst disasters ever to occur in this country. From June to August of that year, flooding across the Midwest, including Wisconsin, caused 50 deaths and $15 billion in damage. To make communities more resilient, Wisconsin’s legislature created a grant program that helps property owners leave flood-prone properties and converts their land to open space, such as wetlands or recreational areas. From 2002 to 2016, the program funded buyouts of 127 structures, reducing the risk for homeowners and helping to contain future floods.","Series of flood disasters, including Great Flood of 1993, ravage state","State grants for range of activities, including buyouts",127 structures relocated out of harm’s way,mm-wisconsin.jpg,mm-wisconsin-lores.jpg,#

From Jan. 1, 2013 to Oct. 31, 2018, the state reported 987 flood events, with damages exceeding $10 million. Going further back, Indiana has endured a number of major floods, such as one in 2008 that caused over $1 billion in damages to the state. Motivated by the frequency of small floods, as well as the devastating impacts of major storms, Indiana officials in the 1950s adopted a Flood Control Revolving Loan Fund to support projects that can mitigate the effects of flooding, and in 2016, state leaders made important improvements to the program. Indiana’s revolving fund is unique in that it operates entirely with state resources.",Major floods and persistent smaller events cause damage across the state,State revolving fund for flood mitigation supports projects and is replenished as loans are repaid,"Local communities can take out low-interest loans for projects, like updated stormwater systems, aimed at reducing flooding",mm-indiana.jpg,mm-indiana-lores.jpg,#
establishing,Iowa,Iowa Watershed Approach Leads to $1.4 Billion in Flood Prevention Projects,"In 2008, devastating floods across the Midwest left Iowa with an estimated $10 billion in damage. In Cedar Rapids alone, 5,200 homes were destroyed or in disrepair after two weeks of historic rainfall. As the state recovered, policymakers used a portion of federal disaster assistance to create authorities tasked with reducing flood risk across watersheds—as opposed to a more localized, project specific approach. The agriculturally dominant state later established a long-term funding source for communities seeking to mitigate damage from future floods.

establishing,Minnesota,Minnesota Uses Bonds to Support Flood-Ready Infrastructure,"After design problems caused a Minneapolis bridge to collapse in 2007, the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MNDOT) decided to do a comprehensive assessment of the state’s bridges and invest $1.8 billion in upgrading and rebuilding infrastructure. Following three major floods in 2010, MNDOT used a portion of these funds—from bonds issued for road repairs—to make key highways less vulnerable to severe weather. Since 2011, the department has used this funding stream for 34 flood mitigation projects, such as raising roadways and bridges.

Recurrent flooding is a problem. To reduce its vulnerability to flooding, the city council adopted one of the nation’s strongest regulations on construction in a floodplain, with the aim of helping to ensure that projects don’t increase the risk of downstream flooding. The regulations have also lowered flood insurance premiums for many residents because of incentives in the federal flood insurance program.","Flooding in 2004 damages 16,000 homes",Policy required new developments or structural improvements avoid increased flood risk for property owners downstream,Residents receive lower flood insurance premiums due to lower risk,mm-brevard.jpg,mm-brevard-lores.jpg,#
regulating,"Fort Collins, Colorado",Colorado City Revamps Flood-Plain Management After Severe Flood,"In July 1997, 14.5 inches of rain fell on Fort Collins, Colorado, in about 30 hours, triggering flash floods that killed five people and caused more than $250 million in damage to properties. The losses catalyzed city officials to pass stringent regulations in 2000 for construction in the Cache la Poudre River’s flood plain. The regulations prohibited residential construction in 100-year flood plains and required nonresidential development to be built at least 2 feet above projected flood levels. In September 2013, floods devastated many parts of Colorado, but the new policy helped Fort Collins escape relatively unscathed.

Since 2011, the state has been battered by six severe storms—including two hurricanes—requiring millions of dollars in federal public assistance.
