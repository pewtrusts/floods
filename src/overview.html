    Since 2000, floods have cost the United States
    <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/events">
        more than $845 billion in damage
    </a>
    to homes, businesses, and critical infrastructure. The expense of adapting
    to more frequent and severe storms is projected to rise over the next
    several decades, placing a premium on the need to take action now to reduce
    the impacts of future floods.

    “Mitigation Matters,” new research from The Pew Charitable Trusts, identifies 13 states or cities that have adopted policies resulting in effective flood mitigation. To learn more, <a href="#mm-bottom-anchor">read the overview</a>, which includes lessons from these jurisdictions, or go directly to briefs below about each city or state. The policies are organized into three categories: 1) using existing funds for mitigation by redirecting revenue and spending, 2) creating revenue sources, and 3) establishing smarter regulations.
