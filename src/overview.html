    Since 2000, floods have cost the United States
    <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/events">
        more than $845 billion in damage
    </a>
    to homes, businesses, and critical infrastructure. The expense of adapting
    to more frequent and severe storms is projected to rise over the next
    several decades, placing a premium on the need to take action now to reduce
    the impacts of future floods.

    Mitigation Matters identifies 13 states or cities that have adopted
    measures resulting in effective flood mitigation activities. To learn more,
    <a href="#">read the overview</a>, which includes lessons from other jurisdictions
    that have developed flood mitigation policies, or go directly to briefs
    below about each city or state. The policies are organized into three
    categories: 1) using existing funds for mitigation by redirecting revenue
    and spending, 2) creating revenue sources, and 3) establishing smarter
    regulations.
