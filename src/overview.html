    Since 2000, floods have grown more frequent and severe, costing the United
    States more than $800 billion in damage to homes, businesses, and critical
    infrastructure—according to the
    <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/events">
        National Centers for Environmental Information
    </a>
    (part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). The expense
    of adapting to more frequent and severe storms is projected to increase
    over the next several decades, placing a premium on the need to take action
    now to reduce flood impacts in the future.

    Noting the recent increase in such efforts, The Pew Charitable Trusts—in
    partnership with Dewberry—examined policies across the country and
    identified 13 states or cities that have adopted measures resulting in
    effective flood mitigation activities. Detailed in this set of briefs, the
    policies fall into three categories: 1) using existing funds for mitigation
    by redirecting revenue and spending, 2) creating revenue sources for
    mitigation, and 3) creating smarter regulations to reduce flood risk.
